Python, mysql and django should be installed to use the app. 
Ideally python and django should be installed in a virtual environment. You can use the commands below: 

```
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Pull the repo, and run: pip install `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Start the server using `python manage.py runserver', and the backend should be active.
